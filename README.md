# Digital Logic Simulator

Digital Logic Simulator is a Python-based application that allows users to design and simulate digital logic circuits. This project provides a graphical user interface for creating and connecting logic gates, switches, and lights to build complex logic circuits. It also supports cable connections to visualize signal flow.

Double-click on switches to toggle their state.
Right-click on objects to access a context menu for more options. (coming maybe soon)
Enable cable mode by clicking on the cable icon in the menu. Connect objects by clicking and dragging from one pin to another.
Scroll with the middle mouse button to pan the view.


There are still some Bugs to fix and features to add.
